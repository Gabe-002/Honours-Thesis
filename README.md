## Honours Physics Thesis (University of Pretoria, 2025)

**Author:** Gabriel Dominic Richard  

This repository contains my BSc Honours Physics thesis titled:

*To what Extent can Using SKA-Mid Improve Time Delay Estimations of Lensed Objects and Ultimately the Hubble Constant?*

The project involved computational simulations of interferometric observations using CASA, followed by data extraction, analysis, and visualisation using Python.

The thesis is provided as a compressed archive due to GitHub file size limits.
